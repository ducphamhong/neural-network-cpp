# Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

* The game is inspired by the dog [Kabosu](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Doge_(meme)) - one of the hottest memes from 2013 until now and [Flappy Bird](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird) - the famous Vietnamese game developed by Nguyen Ha Dong in 2013.
* Flappy Doge was created using [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) and C++.

_*The resources used in the game are collected from the Internet and most of them have been edited to suit the property of the game, the edit files are saved at the path ./code/res/psd._
